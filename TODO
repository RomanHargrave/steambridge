* Basic GTK framework (but keep the cmd interface).
* Write to shortcuts.vdf
* Python library to read VDF files.
* Write physical letter to Valve overlords asking for forgiveness.
* Clean up the Ruby conversion script.  Consider for a bit about converting to Python for consistency, before rejecting as that'd be a lot of work for little payoff.
* Add support for tracking WINEPREFIXes, including setting up new ones (installing Windows Steam, vcrun2010, etc).
* Get some sort of SteamOS setup going and test SteamBridge there.
