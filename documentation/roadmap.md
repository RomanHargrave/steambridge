# Roadmap

## 0.0.2

* Convert to a not stupid deployed layout.  It's not overly difficult
  to be properly UNIXy.
* Combine client tools into a single steambridge script, with various
  actions as parameters.
* Finally mail letter of permission to Valve overlords begging for permission.

## 0.0.3

* Create a Gtk2 (Gtk3?) GUI for configuration games.
* Automagically install Visual Studio runtime.

## 0.0.4

* Support automagically downloading games from Wine-Steam.  This definitely
  requires a lot of blood, sweat, and tears; unfortunately, but it'll
  be necessary for a lot of games to Just Work.
