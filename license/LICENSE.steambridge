As a note, this codebase copies a small part of Valve Software's
Source SDK 2013.  The SteamBridge code itself does not use, in my
opinion, a substantial portion of the Source SDK.  A very small part
of the SteamAPI headers are reused for the Proxy DLL.  However, as
SteamBridge itself requires the Source SDK for compilation and execution,
it is my belief that you are still held to the Source SDK license.
The original copy of the Source SDK license as of the release used
for development of this library is located at LICENSE.source-sdk-2013.
Third party license notices used by the Source SDK are also included
in thirdpartylegalnotices.txt.
